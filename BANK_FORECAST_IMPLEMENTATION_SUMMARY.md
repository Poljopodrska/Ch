## 🧠 How It Works

### Step 1: Customer Behavior Analysis
For each customer in transaction history:
1. Calculate average payment delay (actual payment - invoice date)
2. Calculate consistency (standard deviation)
3. Identify recent trends (last 3 payments)
4. Compute reliability score based on:
   - Payment consistency (60% weight)
   - Adherence to terms (40% weight)

### Step 2: Prediction Generation
For each open receivable/payable:
1. **Look up customer profile**
   - If exists: Use specific behavior
   - If new: Use conservative defaults (35 days, 30% confidence)

2. **Apply adjustments**
   - Large invoices: +5 days delay
   - High reliability (>80): Use median delay
   - Low reliability (<40): Add std deviation buffer

3. **Calculate confidence**
   - Based on transaction count + reliability score
   - Range: 20-95%

4. **Set predicted date**
   - Start from invoice date + predicted delay
   - Ensure not in past (minimum 7 days future)

### Step 3: CF Module Import
1. Parse daily forecast JSON
2. Map each date to CF grid structure (year/month/week/day)
3. Update receipts directly
4. Distribute disbursements across categories:
   - 60% Essential (Nujni)
   - 25% Conditionally Essential (Pogojno Nujni)
   - 15% Non-Essential (Nenujni)
5. Recalculate all formulas
6. Re-render grid

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Updating Forecasts

**Recommended Frequency**: Weekly or when significant data changes

**Process**:
1. Export latest data from accounting system:
   - Transaction history → `Baza prometa po bankah za leto 2025.xlsx`
   - Receivables → `terjtave PIvka 22.10.25.xlsx`
   - Payables → `obveznosti PIvka 22.10.25.xlsx`

2. Place files in `/BankData/` folder

3. Run update script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/update_bank_forecast.sh
   ```

4. Reload in CF module (click button again)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Limitations
- **Year constraint**: Only processes 2025 data (matches CF module year)
- **New customers**: Use default estimates (35 days, low confidence)
- **Overdue items**: Accelerated to 7 days from now
- **Category distribution**: Fixed ratios (60/25/15) for disbursements

### Data Quality Dependencies
- Requires consistent date formats in Excel files
- Customer names must match between files
- Transaction history should be complete and accurate
- Outliers (>1000 day delays) may skew averages

### Best Practices
- Review customer profiles quarterly
- Update forecasts weekly
- Compare predictions to actual payments for validation
- Adjust disbursement distribution ratios if needed
- Flag and investigate low-reliability customers
