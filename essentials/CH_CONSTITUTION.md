# Ch Project Constitution

## Core Principles (Adapted from AVA OLO Framework)

### 1. LLM-First Development
All features must be designed for LLM interaction from the ground up. Every interface, API, and process should prioritize machine-readable formats and clear, structured communication.

### 2. Privacy-First Architecture
User data protection is non-negotiable. All systems must implement end-to-end encryption, minimal data retention, and clear user consent mechanisms.

### 3. Module Independence
Each module must function independently with no cross-dependencies. A failure in one module must never cascade to others.

### 4. Error Isolation
Errors must be contained within their originating module. Each module must have comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 5. Version Visibility
Every component must clearly display its version number. Version mismatches must be detected and reported immediately.

### 6. Deployment Protection
No deployment without protection gates. Every production push must pass through pre-deployment verification and have rollback capabilities.

### 7. Change Tracking
Every change must be logged in SYSTEM_CHANGELOG.md with dual timestamps (UTC | CET), change type, and impact assessment.

### 8. Zero Regression Tolerance
Once a feature works, it must continue working. Any regression is a critical failure requiring immediate attention.

### 9. Test Coverage
Every feature must have comprehensive tests. The MANGO TEST for Ch: "Any feature in Ch project works for any use case in any country."

### 10. Documentation Standards
All code must be self-documenting. Complex logic requires clear explanations. Task Specifications (TS) drive all development.

### 11. Performance Monitoring
Every component must have performance metrics. Degradation must trigger alerts before user impact.

### 12. Security by Design
Security cannot be an afterthought. Every feature must undergo security review before implementation.

### 13. Scalability Planning
Design for 10x current load. Every architectural decision must consider future growth.

### 14. User Experience Excellence
Every interaction must be intuitive. Complexity must be hidden behind simple interfaces.

### 15. Continuous Improvement
Regular reviews, updates, and optimizations. The system must evolve with user needs and technological advances.

## Implementation Mandate

These principles are not suggestions - they are requirements. Every line of code, every design decision, and every deployment must align with these principles.

**The MANGO RULE for Ch**: Any feature must work for any use case in any country, maintaining consistency and reliability across all contexts.
